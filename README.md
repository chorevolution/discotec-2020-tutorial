**CHOReVOLUTION IDRE: An Integrated Development and Run-time Environment for Automatically Realizing and Executing Distributed Applications.**

Since late 70â€™s, the development of concurrent and distributed systems has been receiving much attention from the research community. Choreographies are a form of distributed composition that model the external interaction of the participant services by specifying peer-to-peer message exchanges from a global perspective. When third-party services are to be composed, obtaining the distributed coordination logic required to enforce the realizability of the specified choreography is a non-trivial and error prone task. Automatic support is then needed. CHOReVOLUTION is a platform for the tool-assisted development and execution of choreography-based applications that leverage the distributed collaboration of services specified through service choreographies. It offers an Integrated Development and Runtime Environment (IDRE) comprising a wizard-aided development environment, a system monitoring console, and a back-end for managing the deployment and execution of the system. The tutorial introduces the fundamentals of service choreographies and the CHOReVOLUTION approach as first. Then the introduction of the approach is followed by hands on exercises, where every attendee takes part in developing sample choreography-based distributed applications by using the CHOReVOLUTION IDRE.
